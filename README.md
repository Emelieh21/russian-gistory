# Russian GIStory  - The Statistics of Soviet Dining

This project aims to put data on state restaurants in Soviet times on the map. A project by Olav and Emelie Hofland.

Main objectives:

1. Build historical shapefiles for the territory of the USSR for three "time slices" in the post-WWII era (proposed: 1950,1959 and 1990) containing data on the boundaries of the USSR, Union Republics, Regions (oblasts, krai etc.) and regions' administrative centers. 

Potential deliverables: USSR1950.shp, USSR1959.shp and USSR1990.shp. 

On the job: Emelie and Olav.

See examples for historical GIS for whole countries at https://www.gislounge.com/find-gis-data-historical-country-boundaries/

See shapefile with data for the Former Soviet Union (FSU) for 1995/7 (?) by ESRI (1998) at https://daac.ornl.gov/RLC/guides/RLC_admin_bound.html


2. Collect historical data (in .xls format) on the Soviet Union's state-run catering system (общественное питание) on a regional level, focussing on the three time-slices proposed above. First dataset should contain simple numbers of different types of catering establishments. Other data, such as revenue, total number of seats and output of dishes can be collected in later stages.

Potential deliverables: USSR_cateringstat_1950_1959_1990_numberofestablishments.xls

For sources see http://istmat.info/statistics; printed sources can be found in the library of the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, the Russian National Library in Saint-Petersburg and the Russian State Library in Moscow. Note: expect that regional data for different Union Republics will be hard to find.


3. Combine the shapefiles for 1950, 1959 and 1990 with the corresponding data in an interactive map. Can be generated in R. 

Potential deliverables: maps, maps, maps!
